Virality predictions on social networks are complex contagions, which means, the more highly clustered community a post enters, the more viral it goes. In this project, we are detecting community structures from a twitter account, by taking into consideration, the number of followers of a root user and consecutive followers of followers, to a certain depth. The highly clustered the community is, the chance of a post shared in the same going viral is high. We also propose that community detection alone is not enough to predict which exact tweet will go viral. As a result, this project also presents the virality prediction of the exact tweet with the help of its features, i.e., the number of likes and retweets. The experiments are performed with the help of machine learning models of K-Mean, Multi Layer Perceptron Regressor and Bag of Words respectively, on a real-world data set related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic faced across the world, which is extracted through a public twitter API.
